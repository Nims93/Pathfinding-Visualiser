# Pathfinding Visualiser

### Made with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS

![Pathfinding Visualiser Demo](src/assets/Pathfinding-Visualiser-Demo.webp)

This app visualises 5 pathfinding and 3 maze generation algorithms. Fully responsive and works just as well on mobile sized devices and touch inputs.

#### If you like to try it out, the application is live here:

##### The pathfinding algorithms are:

- **A\*** - Guranteed Shortest Path
- **Greedy Breadth First Search** - Lowest amount of visited nodes
- **Bi-Directional Breadth First Search** - Unweighted lower visited nodes than bfs
- **Breadth First Search** - Basic Search
- **Depth First Search** - Brute force search akin to turning left at every junction in a maze to guarantee you find the exit

#### The maze generation algorithms are:

- **Recursive Division** - Creates long corridoors
- **Recursive Backtracker** - Creates winding paths
- **Random Walls Generator** - Places walls nodes in random places

I made this application to get a full grasp of javascript as the best way to learn is through creating. I love buildingit and I hope you enjoy using it!
